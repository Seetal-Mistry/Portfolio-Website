   <h1>About me</h1>
   <img class="portrait" src="seetal.jpg" />
   <p> As mentioned before… My name is Seetal Mistry and I’m a student at the University of Hertfordshire studying Digital Media Design. At A-level I studied photography,
      film studies and media studies which is where I discovered my interest in design. Other than design, I also enjoy photography, as you can clearly see from my portfolio as well as editing using Adobe Photoshop.
      <br></br>At University, I was given more opportunities to see what design can fall in to and different things I could create like illustration for example. I am still developing my skills and learning new ones however,
         not all my work is on here CLEARLY, I’ve only put a small amount of work that I personally like because as they say… You are your own worst critic.
